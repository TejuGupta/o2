Random mode test execution
--------------------------

If the number of machines = 1 or if the attribute = local 
	if attribute = multiple
			run all the executables on a single host that many number of times specified in the UI
	else
			then all the executables are run on a single host
Else,
	if attribute != multiple
			executables are spread across available hosts mentioned in the machine configuration file
			if the number of machines < no. of executables
				more than one executable would be assigned for the machines
				distribute the executables across machines in a round-robin manner such that server process machine != client process machine
				if server process machine == client process machine
					redistribute the executables such that server process machine != client process machine
			
	if attribute = multiple
			create duplicate processes of the specified process specified number of times
			if the number of machines < no. of executables
				more than one executable would be assigned for the machines
				distribute the executables across machines in a round-robin manner such that server process machine != client process machine
				if server process machine == client process machine
					redistribute the executables such that server process machine != client process machine
